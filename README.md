# Untitled Chat App
I wrote this webapp as a way to learn NodeJS and WebSockets. It has no security features, no user control and no encryption.

Technologies used:
* NodeJS
* EJS
* ExpressJS
* WebSockets
* Bootstrap
* JQuery

## Installing
If (for some reason), you want to try this, just download the repo, and inside the directory, run the following:
```console
npm install
npm run
```
This should run the app on port 3000, this can be changed with the `.env` file.
